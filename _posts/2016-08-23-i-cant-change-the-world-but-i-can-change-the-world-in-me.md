### Beer...the best long drink in the world. It is a drink that has changed and civilized us, yet too often we think that a beer is just a beer, a standard product in our industrial society.

### Beer enthusiast, trying to imagine a world without beer is like trying to imagine a world without a sky or the stars above. It is a normal part of human life for so many of us that it can all too easily by taken for granted. Beer is a product of the land however, made with wonderful natural ingredients. It is the art, the craft, and science of the brewer that turn these ingredients into beer.

### Beer is one of the oldest and most popular drinks known to man. It is thought that about 10,000 years ago in the Middle East, nomadic peoples began to grow and harvest grain and set up settlements near the fields. Some archaeologists believe the reason man did this was to make beer.

### An ancient oral poem from Babylonia called the Gilgamesh Epic tells the story of the civilizing influence of brewing.First told some 4,000 years ago, it is the story of Enkidu, an uncivilized man who was taught to eat bread and drink beer. Enkidu drank seven cups of beer and his "heart soared". According to the legend he washed and became a refined human being...beer had tamed him.

### The first records of brewing are in the Middle East in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians 6,000 years ago. At least 3,000 years before the Christian era, an intoxicating drink, made from grains, was providing nutrition to people in Egypt. The writings of the Roman historians Pliny record that a fermented drink made from corn and water was drunk regularly across much of Northern Europe.

### As well as enjoyment, there was a religious side to early beer brewing, and around the world today in tribal communities there are still social ceremonies where an ancient form of beer was drunk.These ceremonies acknowledge gratitude to the gods.

### Beer in ancient times was like bread, one of life's essentials. It provide quick calories and, because it was boiled, was safer than water to drink. Wherever agriculture and the cultivation of grain went, beer followed.
